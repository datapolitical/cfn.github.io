      <p>I was born in Silicon Valley and spent much of my formative years at the Java offices on Alma. I went to computer camp every summer from 1995-1999. While some kids learned to swim, I learned to code.</p>

<p>So you’d expect from that background someone who’s passionate about technology and loves to socialize with engineers. That’s certainly high on my list of takeaways, but it’s not at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Michael Arrington wrote a great piece last year about how what’s required from individuals working at a successful startup hasn’t changed in almost two decades, despite protests from this new crop of coders. It resonated with me because the guys in ‘94 were my role models; their dedication taught me what was important in life.</p>

<p>What hits me most directly is the fact that, from everything I saw around the office, those guys (and a few awesome gals) weren’t there to earn Fuck you money.</p>

<p>A solid salary and a nice options package didn’t hurt, but this group of 24 people knew they we working on a project that would change the tech landscape, and they didn’t expect fame or fortune for doing so.</p>

<p>What this group did care about was each other; they bonded over a shared mission, over innovation, relationship building, and shared life experiences. My mom never talked about how a friend was leaving after he had vested, she mentioned how his son just graduated high school.</p>

<p>I don’t think the profession has changed from 1995. Coders are still coders, and solving the big problems is still incredibly hard.</p>

<p>What has changed is the expectations about why you join the ecosystem, and what the explosion in access to the web has done to change it.</p>

<p>People expect a lot more money today for less work. The problem is that to get the former, 20 years ago you had to build Facebook, today they just have to buy you.</p>

<p>This is great for the talent market, but for tech employees writ large, it creates a false sense of what makes for a truly successful company, and why what happened to Detroit hasn’t happened here.</p>

<p>We have a competitive advantage because of the talent pool, but more than that, mostly because the ethos of this place, of what’s behind real innovation, is built into our DNA.</p>

<p>Most people learn that over time, some never do. I was blessed to have been raised on it. Thus, I believe the problem comes from tech employees not having enough time here to fully acclimate to the environment. The 90% that doesn’t get that eight-figure exit sees the 10% who do and think that’s what it means to live here, that that’s why you do what you do.</p>

<p>I think that’s why so many startups fail. The guys who run them don’t take the long-view; they create a reality distortion field, but not a healthy one.</p>

<p>Java changed the world; it happened not because of a militant manager or even a solid vision. It happened because the people who were building it supported each other and cared more product value than about valuation.</p>

<p>Startups today that focus on the latter may pay big, but most of them fail. It’s putting your salary and your life on number 36 and hoping to hit it big.</p>

<p>The startups that succeed do so by taking the long view (AirBNB is a great example). Building something that 20 people will work on and 200 million people will use is the valuation that matters to them. Solving the hard problem is what they try to do each day. These guys still exist here; they’re the ones who keep it Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>So if you’re wondering why you’re working so hard, ask yourself three questions:
1) What’s my long-term goal?
2) How well are my coworkers/managers helping me get there?
3) For how long will the sucess of what I’m building matter to people outside my office?</p>

<p>If you don’t have the right answers, reconsider what you expect to get out of your career in tech. If your founders don’t have the right answers, reconsider why you’re working for them.</p>

<p>TL;DR It’s about the culture. It’s about the substance. All the rest is noise.</p>

      <p>Designers are great at considering the use cases that make sense to them. But an A/C unit that someone would operate at night? why bother to make the control panel glow?</p>

<p>It’s a cautionary tale; consider those use cases that don’t make sense to you, the ones where you wonder why someone would ever want to operate your product in such a strange manner. as it turns out, there might just be a market fit. (The corellary to this is develop a MVP that fits your vision and see how people use it). As someone said on Branch a while back, if you aren’t ashamed of v1.0, you launched too late.</p>

<p>Then again, I could just install a night light.</p>

      <p>I’m writing this on my iPhone (full disclosure, this will be partially about blogging). It feels incredibly odd, like eating pancakes with a caviar fork. I love this device, but complex content creation is not its strong suit. </p>

<p>Yet, it is awesome with micro-creation. Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr all work beautifully on mobile, because they are not designed to feel like a blank canvas. People have time to revise because they only have to review 140 characters.</p>

<p>The barrier for content creation is friction. It takes far longer to get on my laptop when I want to write. Even if the idea deserves long-form, instad of blogging, I will post on Facebook and then share the post on Twitter (this practice has to stop, but that is a whole other can of tuna).</p>

<p>So I’m writing this on my iPhone because I know if I add a reminder, the actual work I have to finish will take over and I will not bother to write anything today.</p>

<p>What scares me is that the guys ten years younger than me don’t use a PC unless you put a gun to their heads. The result is obvious, they love short-form composition. Tumblr gains on Blogger not on its merits (though it is wicked smart), but on its ease of use among 14-21 year olds.</p>

<p>So the question is simple: will a generation raised on smartphones create long-form content?</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m going to upload this post, I’ll share it on Facebook and Twitter, and then take it to Branch (when that is live, I’ll update this with the link).</p>

<p>Same warning: this was written on a mobile device, so there may be errors I didn’t catch. </p>

      <p>It sucked, and it was awesome.</p>

<p>Spoiler Alert
.
.
The Newsroom 1.10 and Breaking Bad 5.7
(At some point I’ll learn how to do this with markdown)
.
.
Spoiler Alert</p>

<p>I LOVED Breaking Bad tonight. It was the epitome of great television, riveting, personal, visceral, with just the right amount of foreshadowing.</p>

<p>Yes, I called it when I saw Walt grab the gun and the money, but I was still surprised by Mike’s resignation at the end. Vince Gilligan always delivers good television, and sometimes, like tonight, he just owns it.</p>

<p>Contrast that with The Newsroom. I was dissatisfied with last week’s show because Sorkin continued a pattern he’d used throughout the series: give you just enough of a high to keep you coming back. Stick the landing because that’s what we all like to see. I was hoping tonight would be different.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Sorkin played it safe, he tied everything up nicely. He broke it off amicably at the end of the school year with just enough sentimentalism that you might get back together when the next semester starts.</p>

<p>By contrast, Vince Gilligan shot a kid in cold blood on basic cable, and then used Jesse’s experience over three seasons to slowly build up his disconnect from Walt. It was real when Jesse walked out, and just as real when Walt hired the guy who killed the kid.</p>

<p>The amount of poetic awesomeness just in that act, the self-reference that went completely unremarked was the polar opposite of the way the Newsroom ended. Sorkin explained every single detail, he repeated the Don Quixote trope so many times you felt like it was The Newsroom, summer school edition.</p>

<p>The point of being on cable is that you can take risks. The point of being on HBO is so you can take risks and know the audience has physical buy-in; you know they’ve watched the episodes in order.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR</em> Vince Gilligan is Walt, playing it incredibly dangerous, taking no prisoners and beating everyone else in the process. He’s Heisenberg.</p>

<p>Sorkin badly, badly wants to be Don Quixote, he wants to be Will, crafting a show that’s bold, thought-provoking and controversial. But instead he wrote like Jay Leno, safe and deadly afraid of losing his audience.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Sports Night was risky, too much so from a fiscal standpoint. But it was good most of the time and sometimes reached for the stars. I hate to say it, but when it comes to TV, Sorkin has lost his nerve. Fortunately his movies have still been quite epic, so I’m looking forward to his adaptation of Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>And hey, if he’s having trouble, Breaking Bad is ending; he can always ask Vince Gilligan for some help.</p>

<p>P.P.S.
This was written on my iPhone in a code editor. There may be errors in grammar and spelling.</p>
